# 🌵 Catcus  

**Catcus** is a personal project (still in development) built with **Vite** and **React**.  
It helps cat owners discover whether a plant is toxic for their cats.

## 🧩 Project Structure  

The app is divided into React components, each with its own SCSS stylesheet:  

- `Header`  
- `Main`  
- `Plants`  
- `Footer`  

Data about plants is stored in a **local JSON file**, acting as a small database.
