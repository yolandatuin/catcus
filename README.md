# 🌵 Catcus  

**Catcus** is a personal project (still in development) built with **Vite** and **React**.  
It helps cat owners discover whether a plant is toxic for their cats.

## ✨ Features  

- 🔍 **Search bar** – check if a plant is toxic by typing its name.

- 🕒 **Recent searches** – will store user searches in the future (WIP 🚧).  
- 🌱 **Other plants / More** – browse an extended list of plants.  
- 📱 **Responsive design** – works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- 🎨 **Custom SCSS styling** – each component has its own style file.

## 🧩 Project Structure  

The app is divided into React components, each with its own SCSS stylesheet:  

- `Header`  
- `Main`  
- `Plants`  
- `Footer`  

Data about plants is stored in a **local JSON file**, acting as a small database.
